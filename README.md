# A3C-implementation-in-python
This is a clean implementation of A3C algorithm in python using pytorch

The dependencies that you need to install are:
Installing all the necessary libraries with appropriate version. The key is to keep running and handling the errors until you find the appropriate version.
Then you will also have to edit the lib-file named time_limit.py from venv>lib>site-packages>gym>wrappers>time_limit.py 

Train the model using train.py
Test the model using test.py

You can also watch my video on youtube to get an idea of the bigger picture and help with running the code files;
